The online supplementary materials contain four sections. Section 1 shows the double robustness of PENCOMP.
Section 2 describes the implementations of IPTW and AIPTW estimators.  
Section 3 includes supplementary tables from our simulation studies (one time point and two time points). Finally, section 4 includes additional tables from our application. 

The Codes folder contains all the codes that we used. Inside the folder, there are three separate folders: Application, oneTimePointSimulation, and twoTimePointSimulation.
Inside each of these three folders, there is a ReproduceTablesandFigures.pdf detailing the codes and how to reproduce the tables and figures.
